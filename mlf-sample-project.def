# We are going to start with a base image from NVIDIA, which is a Ubuntu system with CUDA and cuDNN installed.
# You can also use a different base image. There are many available on Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com).
# For instance, there are images for PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, HuggingFace, MosaicML, etc.
# Most of the aforementioned images start with a NVIDIA base image like the below, so we will use that as our base for simplicity.
# To do so, change the FROM line below to the url of the image tag you want to use.
Bootstrap: docker
From: nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04
